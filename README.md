This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of historical trade data from various Binance accounts over 90 days. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate and rank accounts based on several key financial metrics derived from their trading activities.

Objective
The objective of this project is to calculate and rank Binance accounts based on the following metrics:

- ROI (Return on Investment): Measures the profitability of the trades relative to the initial investment.
- PnL (Profit and Loss): Calculates the total profit or loss for each account from its trades.
- Sharpe Ratio: A measure of risk-adjusted return that helps identify the risk-reward balance.
- MDD (Maximum Drawdown): Evaluates the worst loss from peak to trough, reflecting downside risk.
- Win Rate: The percentage of trades that resulted in a profit.
- Win Positions: The number of profitable positions executed by the account.

Methodology
 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning:

- Loaded and inspected the historical trade dataset to check for missing values and cleaned the data for analysis.

2. Feature Engineering:

- Derived key financial metrics such as ROI, PnL, Sharpe Ratio, MDD, and Win Rate using trade details.
- Identified the position type (e.g., long_open, long_close) and categorized trades accordingly using the side and positionSide columns.
- Calculated the profit or loss from each trade based on the realized profit.

3. Ranking Algorithm:

- Developed a ranking algorithm that uses the calculated metrics to rank Binance accounts based on their trading performance. Accounts are ranked from the most to least profitable and efficient.

4. Results and Insights:

- Provided a detailed ranking of the top 20 accounts based on the calculated financial metrics.

Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook or Python Script: Complete code for analysis and calculation of metrics.
- CSV File: Contains the calculated metrics for all accounts.
- Top 20 Accounts List: Ranked list of accounts based on their performance metrics.
- Report: A concise report detailing the methodology, assumptions, and findings of the analysis.

Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Future Improvements
- Incorporating more advanced risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR).
- Enhancing the Sharpe ratio calculation to incorporate transaction costs.
- Real-time data analysis by linking the script to live trade data from Binance API.
